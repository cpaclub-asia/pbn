<summary>🤝 Agreements</summary>
   
1. This project exclusively focuses on utilizing domains with a history, specifically drop domains.
2. We only consider domains that allow us to retrieve website content 
* From public archives (web.archive.org or commoncrawl.org)
* Alternatively, we may preserve the content ourselves when the domain is in the expired state but remains accessible.
We don't work with domains without history or without content

## 📊 Workflow
### Domains

📝 Make a list from:
- Google SERP (our/competitors keywords)
- Outgoing links from big sites (Wikipedia, GitHub, GitLab, ...), also can take Top-3 from Google
- Majestic Million

using Semrush or wget+rapser

#### 📝 Drop Domains
look for Domains, that are Expired(Potential New Drops) or Free/Available (old drops)





### ✏️ Content
🔍 Parsed from web.archive.org or commoncrawl.org
⚙️ Processing of parsef content:
- Use our own tools to parse content
- Restore content as CSV for later upload to our WordPress


⚙️ Process for drop domains:
1. Make a list of potential domains
2. Check the list by combining domain and parsed content

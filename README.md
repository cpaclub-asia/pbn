# PBN (Private Blog Network) Project

🌐 **Overview**
This project aims to create PBNs (Private Blog Networks) for SEO purposes, focusing on the selection and acquisition of domains and content. The PBNs can be categorized based on domain history and content source.

## 📋 Domain
Domains can be classified as either "new" or "drop."

### New Domains
✨ No history

### Drop Domains
📝 Make a list from:
- Google
- Wikipedia
- GitHub (using Semrush)

⚙️ Process for drop domains:
1. Make a list of potential domains
2. Check the list by combining domain and parsed content

## ✏️ Content
Content can be classified as either "new" or "old."

### New Content
🔍 Parsed from web.archive.org or commoncrawl.org

⚙️ Process for new content:
- Use our own tools to parse content
- Restore content as CSV for later upload to our WordPress

### Old Content
📝 Easy to buy but limited quality

## 📝 Drop Domains
Drop domains can be further categorized into "new drops" or "old drops."

### New Drops and Bids
📝 To-do list

## ⚙️ Domain Selection
- Check the list of drop domains
- Consider factors such as content, PR (Page Rank), and manual domain selection

## ⬆️ WordPress Integration
After buying a domain, upload the old information to WordPress.

📊 **Project Workflow**

1. Identify domain needs:
   - Determine if a new or drop domain is required.
   - Define the content requirements (new or old).

2. Domain Acquisition:
   - For new domains:
     - Start with no history.
   - For drop domains:
     - Generate a list from Google, Wikipedia, and GitHub using Semrush.
     - Combine domain and parsed content to check the list.

3. Content Gathering:
   - For new content:
     - Parse content from web.archive.org or commoncrawl.org using our tools.
     - Restore content as CSV for later WordPress upload.
   - For old content:
     - Purchase domains with readily available content.

4. Drop Domains:
   - Categorize drop domains as new drops or old drops.
   - Manage new drops and bids based on priorities.

5. Domain Selection:
   - Perform manual domain selection based on factors like content quality, PR, etc.

6. WordPress Integration:

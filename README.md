1. This project exclusively focuses on utilizing domains with a history, specifically drop domains.
2. We only consider domains that allow us to retrieve website content 
* From public archives (web.archive.org or commoncrawl.org)
* Alternatively, we may preserve the content ourselves when the domain is in the expired state but remains accessible.
We don't work with domains without history or without content
